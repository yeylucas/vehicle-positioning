# vehicle-positioning

## Abstract

This project implements machine learning (ML) and neural network methods for vehicle positioning in an underground parking lot using Channel State Information (CSI) data.

CSI data provides information about wireless signal propagation between transmitters and receivers. Using CSI to determine vehicle positioning is useful when applied to autonomous vehicles that need to perform navigation and tracking to avoid collisions and communicate with other vehicles. We found that neural networks outperform ML models in accuracy for both LoS/NLoS classification and position estimation, but require significantly more computation and training time.
